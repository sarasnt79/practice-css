                <h3 class="m-1">Emily Ridge — Web Designer & Developer</h3>

                <p class="Description m-1 p-1">After graduating in 2009 with a Bachelor’s Degree (First Class Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design, I spent the last nine years working both as a freelance web developer and designer and as part of a team in various companies across Galway, Dublin, Berlin and Melbourne. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.

                    As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several graphic designers in Berlin and Melbourne, at the same time maintaining clients in Germany, Ireland, Australia and the UK.
                    
                    I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (PHP, HTML, CSS, LESS, JS, jQuery, WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), eCommerce Solutions, Corporate Branding and Graphic Design. During my Multimedia degree I studied Information Architecture, and therefore have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design which I put to good use on every project I work on.
                    
                    I am currently working in Ireland between Dublin and Galway. I am always available to discuss your project over the phone or via Skype. These days I enjoy spending my free time riding my bike, baking and crocheting.

                <h3 class="m-1">Nicholas Grundy — Photographer, Copywriter & Translator</h3>

                <p class="Description m-1 p-1">Since turning my passion into a career, I’ve worked as a professional photographer in Germany, Australia and Ireland. I’ve received numerous awards and my photographs have appeared in various galleries across the globe. They’re also found in publications such as Time Magazine, The Sydney Morning Herald Newspaper, Australian Geographic, and on the cover of Tasmania 40° South Magazine. My fine art prints appear in the University of Melbourne’s collection and in various private homes and institutions across Australia, Europe, and the United States.

                    I’ve worked together with Emily for a number of years now. Apart from conducting photo shoots for her websites, I also collaborate regularly with Emily to provide clear and succinct content writing. In addition, I provide the full gamut of SEO services, including not only content, image and website structure optimisation, but also regular maintenance, Google Analytics reporting, and the creation and management of Google AdWords campaigns.
                    
                    I also provide German translating and interpreting. I’m fluent in German, having lived in Berlin for three years, and I regularly translate entire websites for various translation clients and localisation and IT companies around the world.
                    
                    My eye for detail, creative view on the world, and meticulous nature have left me with many highly satisfied clients. I look forward to speaking with you soon about your unique project, be it photography, copywriting, SEO or translation!
